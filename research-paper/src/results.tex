\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

This section presents the results from training text-conditioned diffusion models on MNIST and evaluating the impact of classifier-free guidance.

\subsection{Experiment 1: Baseline Training Results}

\subsubsection{Training Convergence}
The model was trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 512 and learning rate of $10^{-3}$. Training progress showed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initial convergence:} Loss decreased rapidly within the first epoch
    \item \textbf{Training stability:} Consistent loss reduction across all 5 epochs
    \item \textbf{Step-wise monitoring:} Loss logged every 25 steps revealed smooth optimization without instabilities
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Capacity}
The custom UNet2DConditionModel contains approximately 2.6 million trainable parameters, demonstrating that effective text-to-image generation is achievable with relatively compact architectures on simple domains.

\subsubsection{Qualitative Generation Quality}
Generated samples from prompts like "A handwritten digit 4" and "A handwritten digit 5" showed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recognizable digit structures
    \item Adherence to specified digit class in text prompt
    \item Grayscale appearance consistent with MNIST dataset
    \item Some variation in style and thickness
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experiment 2: Classifier-Free Guidance Ablation}

\subsubsection{Guidance Scale Impact}
We evaluated guidance scales $w \in \{0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100\}$ for the prompt "A handwritten digit 0". Key observations:

    \begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Guidance Scale} & \textbf{Text Alignment} & \textbf{Image Quality} \\
        \hline
        $w = 0$ & None (unconditional) & Random digit, no control \\
        \hline
        $w = 5$ & Weak & Somewhat follows prompt \\
        \hline
        $w = 10$ & Moderate & Good balance \\
        \hline
        $w = 20$ & Strong & High adherence to prompt \\
        \hline
        $w = 50$ & Very strong & May show over-saturation \\
        \hline
        $w = 100$ & Extreme & Potential artifacts \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Key Findings}

\paragraph{$w = 0$ (No Guidance):}
Without guidance, the model generates random digits regardless of the text prompt, confirming that conditioning is necessary for text-controlled generation.

\paragraph{$w = 5$ to $w = 10$ (Weak to Moderate):}
These scales provide reasonable text-image alignment while maintaining natural-looking samples. The generated digits match the prompt most of the time.

\paragraph{$w = 20$ (Strong Guidance):}
Strong guidance further improves text adherence. Generated samples consistently match the specified digit class with high confidence.

\paragraph{$w = 50$ to $w = 100$ (Extreme Guidance):}
Very high guidance scales may lead to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Over-saturation of pixel values
    \item Loss of natural variation
    \item Potential introduction of artifacts
    \item Images that look "too confident" or unnatural
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visual Comparison}
Figure \ref{fig:guidance_comparison} (generated from the notebook visualization) shows a side-by-side comparison of outputs across all guidance scales for the same prompt and random seed, clearly demonstrating the progressive strengthening of text conditioning.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Inference Performance}

\subsubsection{Generation Speed}
With 50 inference steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Single image generation completes in several seconds on GPU
    \item Classifier-free guidance doubles computational cost (two forward passes per step)
    \item Trade-off between quality and speed controllable via number of steps
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reproducibility}
Fixed random seed (422) ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identical outputs for same prompt and guidance scale
    \item Controlled comparisons across different settings
    \item Reproducible experimental results
\end{itemize}
